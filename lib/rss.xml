<br>a redheaded half-elf and rich-looking wood elf come downstairs from their rooms
<br>the redhead buys a shot at the bar, and the wood elf takes a seat at a table
<br>a mysterious-looking half-elf is whispering to someone at a table under the stairs
<br>the tavern’s newly hired human helper takes a bottle of wine upstairs to room 204
<br>The roomskeeper&nbsp;<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Xavier Effie**" data-href="Xavier Effie**" href="3.-npcs/the-last-line-tavern/xavier-effie**.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Xavier</a>&nbsp;loudly summons everyone in the tavern for a game of darts

 <br><br>
<br>The entire kingdom is surrounded by physical and magical walls. The physical walls between cities are thiner and shorter than the outermost walls. This allows for air and ground travel between cities without seeing anything beyond the kingdom. The outermost walls are about thirteen miles (20.9 km) in height, and the inner cities' walls are about 6 miles (9.65 km) in height.
<br>The physical walls seemingly extend infinitely underground, and attempts to find the end in the past has lead to devastating casualties.
<br>All air travel has a maximum altitude before simply being unable to work. The maximum altitude is the height of the outermost walls.
<br>The magical walls are best seen from the sky. A iridescent shimmer can be seen in certain lighting from above as it makes a seemingly dome shape across the kingdom. Magic users and philosophers have hypothesized that the day and night cycle is simulated by the magical barrier. Records show all types of weather patterns to have occurred in the past, but in recent centuries extreme weather changes have come far and few between.
<br><br>
<br>Due to the manner in which the kingdom was formed, there has always been a startling lack of a fertile soil. In the beginning, all fertile soil was blessed by Emer and given to the Royal Family to manage. Only this blessed soil has the capacity to grow life.
<br>In modern times, having this soil has been a sign of great wealth or an indication of close ties with the Royal Family. 
<br>When <a data-href="The Garden" href="2.-world/2.3-geography/landmarks/the-garden.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">The Garden</a> was being constructed, the Family donated blessed soil to the temple. Over the centuries an enormous tree has grown from it, and has become a symbol of a potential future.
<br><br>
<br>Other than the blessed soil, water is the second most regulated resource in Eora. Initially it was also given to the Royal Family to manage, but as Eora grew the Family handed the responsibility to the <a data-href="Council of Eora#Head Councilman of Water" href="2.-world/2.4-government/2.44-council-of-eora/council-of-eora.html#Head_Councilman_of_Water" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Head Councilman of Water</a> and their respective boards.
<br>All water is sourced from the Trench. The Trench is a chasm of groundwater the circles around <a data-href="Hollyhock" href="2.-world/2.3-geography/cities/hollyhock.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Hollyhock</a>. The only time the public has access ti the Trench is on Blessings of <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Tempest, the Waterbearer" data-href="Tempest, the Waterbearer" href="2.-world/2.6-deities/2.61-the-true-gods/tempest,-the-waterbearer.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">the Waterbearer</a>. On this day (that occurs once every eight years), the Trench is opened in  a feat of engineering, and the Waterbearer pours rain only into the chasm. 
<br>Water is mostly used for hydroponic farming. With the list of crops being reduced to only potatoes, wheat and rice overtime. 
<br><br><br>
<br>The crops that remain are only potatoes, wheat and rice. Rice is expensive, and is mostly seen in upper-class districts and cities. Wheat and potatoes are more plentiful and cheap, and are a staple in most dishes. 
<br>Other produce, spices, condiments, etc. are now chemically manufactured.
<br>Meat and poultry are plentiful and are also a staple in most dishes. 
<br>Drinkable water is seen as a symbol of wealth, and is expensive to purchase pure. Most people drink milk (or diluted milk), manufactured juices or alcohol.
<br><br>
<br>Buildings and structures dating back to the beginning of Eora were made primarily of wood. As the kingdom grew, newer constructions were built from metal and concrete. Similar to drinkable water, having pure wooden fixtures is a sign of wealth and status.

<br>The building itself is elevated, with a small staircase leading to the front entrance. On either side of the staircase are large white columns that go from ceiling to floor. 
<br><br>
<br>The front area consists of a lobby that showcases exhibits of older mechanisms native to <a data-href="Anemone" href="2.-world/2.3-geography/cities/anemone.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Anemone</a>. The mechanisms are mining tool and manufacturing technologies. The front area also consists of a front desk.
<br>The back section of the temple is the main area. It consists of parallel pews all facing an artsy clock on an intricately designed podium. On either side of the podium are stairs that lead to the second floor.
<br>The second floor has three doors leading to offices to the western side. The northern side has a door leading to the temple's library. The eastern side has a door leading to a small storage room. From the second floor, the entirety of the first floor can be seen. 
<br><br>
<br>A single-story room with shelves of books lining almost every wall. In the center is a cluster of tables, and pressed against the western wall is a couch. Most books only date back a couple of centuries, and the few that don't consist of common texts.

<br>Pronounced [EM-R]
<br><br>In official texts, Emer is imagined as an older woman with brown coiled hair. Her eyes are typically brown or green, but her outfit varies wildly by artist. She’s been depicted wearing farmer clothes, extravagant dresses, and commoner outfits. Her immaterial forms include rumbling earth, crunched leaves, and sounds of nature.<br>Emer’s symbol is of a rose, although any plant imagery can be attributed to her.<br>Historians believe her to be the oldest of the True Gods, and they read about her maturity and wisdom in solving conflicts of long past. Emer is viewed as a gentle and maternal-like figure, although in recent centuries her influence has started to become overshadowed by her fellow gods. <br><br>Emer is the goddess of soil, creatures and remembrance. Her followers are often found in roles relating to preservation. Famous historians, record-keepers, and scribes are known to be devout believers. Farmers are also known to ask for her blessing over crops and animals. <br><br>Over six thousand years ago, the Shadow Flood swept across the lands and consumed everything in its path. To protect those remaining, the 3 True Gods created the Kingdom of Eora as a haven. Vulcan the Inventor, created the kingdom's foundations using his omnipotent knowledge of technology. Tempest the Waterbearer, graced the kingdom with water, its primary resource. Emer of the Soil gave the kingdom life giving it a precious amount of soil, crops, and animals.&nbsp;<br>Soon after establishing the Kingdom of Eora, the True Gods hand-picked and blessed a Dark Elven family (the Pacifics) that would become the Royal Family. The Waterbearer then chose the First Queen of Eora, and the line of succession has run through women ever since. Once the surviving populace was safe within Eora’s walls, the True Gods spent and continued to spend their time battling against the Shadow Flood. They do this with the hope that one day the survivors will be able to walk the earth freely once again.<br><br><br>

 <br><br>In official texts, the Waterbearer is depicted as a willowy woman with dark, liquid-like hair. Her eyes and outfit defer by the artist, but typically she has either blue or black colored eyes, and wears an extravagant dress in shades of blue. The Waterbearer is often shown holding an urn or large bowl, pouring water into fields or into the Trench. Her immaterial forms include crashing/rushing water and calming/booming rain.<br>The original symbol of the Waterbearer was of a sea shell. In modern times, her worshippers made a water droplet her official symbol. <br>Stories of the Waterbearer write her as a benevolent being with an incredible temperament and pose. She is a being that rules above all others and is something to look up to.<br><br>The Waterbearer is the deity of water, change and choice.

His immaterial forms include the clattering of tools, the hum of running machinery, and the ticking of a clock.<br>The Inventor’s symbol is of a clock, one of humanity’s greatest inventions.<br>Due to the earliest recorded images of him, many believe that the Inventor is the youngest of the True Gods. However, he has aged the most over the centuries, and is seen as a great educator and philosopher.<br><br>The Inventor is the god of technology, creativity and innovation.
